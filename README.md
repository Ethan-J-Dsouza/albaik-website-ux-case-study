# Al Baik Website – UX Case Study

## Overview
This case study evaluates the usability and interaction design of the Al Baik official website from the perspective of a regular desktop user. The analysis applies Human-Computer Interaction principles studied during my BSc (Hons) Computer Science programme at the University of Kent.

The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and design trade-offs in the interface, going beyond surface-level heuristic evaluation.

## Context & Personal Use
I regularly use the Al Baik website to browse the menu and explore brand information. This familiarity allows for a reflective evaluation based on repeated interaction rather than a single visit.

## Interface Overview
The website follows a brand-driven design structure with a strong red and white colour scheme, prominent imagery, and a top navigation bar linking to core sections such as Menu and Our Story.

The layout follows a vertically structured scroll model common in modern commercial websites, guiding users through content in a linear and brand-focused narrative flow.

## Heuristic Evaluation

### Visibility of System Status

The Al Baik website provides basic system feedback through hover state changes in the navigation bar. When a user hovers over interactive elements such as "Menu", the colour shift acts as a visual indicator of interactivity. This aligns with web conventions and reduces uncertainty regarding clickability.

However, when transitioning between sections (e.g., from "Menu" to "Our Story"), the interface does not provide explicit loading feedback. Although page transitions are relatively quick, the absence of a visible loading indicator may create brief cognitive uncertainty, particularly under slower network conditions. Users may question whether their action has registered.

From a user experience perspective, even minor delays without feedback can reduce perceived responsiveness. Implementing a subtle loading animation or progress indicator would improve clarity and reinforce the principle of visibility of system status.

### Aesthetic & Minimalist Design

The Al Baik website strongly reflects the brand’s visual identity through its dominant red and white colour palette. The consistent use of these colours reinforces brand recognition and creates immediate visual coherence across pages.

The homepage features large banners and high-resolution food imagery, which contribute to emotional engagement and appetite appeal. From a psychological perspective, this visual emphasis supports marketing goals by directing attention toward products rather than dense textual information.

However, the prominence of large visual elements can impact efficiency. Significant screen space is allocated to branding and imagery before actionable content (such as menu navigation) becomes fully visible. For returning users who visit primarily for functional goals (e.g., checking menu items quickly), this may slightly reduce interaction efficiency.

Despite this, the layout maintains strong visual hierarchy. Headings are clearly differentiated by size and weight, spacing prevents visual clutter, and the navigation bar remains consistently positioned at the top of the interface. This supports cognitive processing by reducing overload and making the structure predictable.

Overall, the design successfully balances brand expression with usability, though minor adjustments to information density could improve efficiency for repeat users.

### Affordances & Signifiers

Affordances refer to the perceived possibilities for action, while signifiers communicate where interaction is possible. On the Al Baik website, primary navigation items in the top bar act as clear signifiers due to their placement, spacing, and alignment with standard web conventions.

Interactive elements such as menu items and navigation links change appearance when hovered over. This visual change functions as a feedback-based signifier, indicating clickability. The cursor transformation further reinforces perceived affordance.

However, some content sections rely heavily on imagery without strong visual cues indicating whether elements are interactive. When images resemble promotional banners rather than buttons, users may hesitate due to ambiguous affordance. This can create minor friction in exploration behaviour.

The use of the brand’s red colour for interactive highlights is effective, as it creates visual consistency. However, because red is also heavily used in static design elements, the distinction between decorative and interactive components could be made clearer through additional cues such as underlines, subtle elevation, or shadow depth.

Overall, the interface follows standard web affordance patterns, but there are opportunities to strengthen signifiers in visually dense sections.

### Micro-Interactions

Micro-interactions are small, contained interface responses that occur during user interaction, such as hover animations, dropdown transitions, and subtle state changes. Although often overlooked, they significantly influence perceived smoothness and professionalism.

On the Al Baik website, hover transitions on navigation elements provide immediate feedback, reinforcing responsiveness. The delay between hover and visual change is minimal, which supports a sense of system reactivity and control.

Dropdown behaviour in the navigation bar follows expected patterns, appearing directly beneath the selected item. This spatial alignment supports predictability and reduces cognitive effort when scanning options.

However, transitions between full pages occur without noticeable animation or transitional feedback. While this keeps the interface simple, the absence of micro-animated continuity may make navigation feel slightly abrupt. Subtle fade or slide transitions could improve perceived fluidity without increasing complexity.

From a user experience perspective, micro-interactions contribute to emotional quality. The current implementation is functional and efficient, but enhanced transitional continuity could elevate the overall experience from usable to refined.

### Design Trade-offs

Every interface design involves trade-offs between competing priorities. In the case of the Al Baik website, a primary trade-off exists between brand expression and interaction efficiency.

The homepage prioritises strong branding through large imagery, bold colour use, and prominent visual banners. This strengthens brand identity and emotional engagement, which is particularly valuable for first-time visitors. However, this design choice reduces immediate information density, meaning users must scroll before accessing detailed content.

Another trade-off involves simplicity versus discoverability. The navigation structure is clean and minimal, which reduces cognitive load. However, deeper content layers are not immediately visible without interaction, potentially limiting exploration for users unfamiliar with the site.

There is also a balance between consistency and visual distinction. The consistent use of red strengthens brand cohesion, but because the same colour is used for both decorative and interactive elements, signifier clarity could occasionally be reduced.

These trade-offs demonstrate that the design is intentional rather than flawed. The interface prioritises marketing and brand storytelling slightly above pure functional efficiency, which aligns with the goals of a commercial food brand website.

### Recommendations

Based on the evaluation, the following improvements could enhance usability without compromising brand identity:

1. **Introduce Subtle Loading Feedback**  
   Adding a minimal loading indicator or transitional animation between pages would improve visibility of system status and reduce cognitive uncertainty during navigation.

2. **Strengthen Interactive Signifiers**  
   Differentiating clickable elements more clearly from decorative components through underlines, elevation, or contrast adjustments would improve affordance clarity.

3. **Optimise Above-the-Fold Efficiency**  
   Reducing the vertical dominance of banner imagery on desktop could allow quicker access to functional content for returning users.

4. **Enhance Micro-Interaction Continuity**  
   Implementing subtle fade or slide transitions between sections would improve perceived fluidity and emotional quality of interaction.

These recommendations aim to refine rather than redesign the interface, preserving its strong brand identity while improving interaction efficiency.

### Reflection & Learning Growth

This case study builds upon feedback received in earlier coursework, where the analysis lacked depth in areas such as signifiers, affordances, and micro-interactions. In this revised evaluation, greater emphasis has been placed on interaction behaviour, perceptual cues, and design trade-offs.

Through this process, I have developed a more structured approach to UX evaluation — moving beyond identifying heuristic violations toward analysing underlying design decisions and their consequences.

The analysis demonstrates a shift from descriptive evaluation toward structured, principle-based critique grounded in HCI theory.

This reflection demonstrates growth in applying Human-Computer Interaction theory to real-world interfaces in a more analytical and professional manner.
