# Al Baik Website – UX Case Study

## Overview
This case study evaluates the usability and interaction design of the Al Baik official website from the perspective of a regular desktop user. The analysis applies Human-Computer Interaction principles studied during my BSc Computer Science degree.

The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and design trade-offs in the interface, going beyond surface-level heuristic evaluation.

## Context & Personal Use
I regularly use the Al Baik website to browse the menu and explore brand information. This familiarity allows for a reflective evaluation based on repeated interaction rather than a single visit.

---

## Interface Overview
The website follows a brand-driven design structure with a strong red and white colour scheme, prominent imagery, and a top navigation bar linking to core sections such as Menu and Our Story.
